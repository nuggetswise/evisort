# Contract Intelligence â€“ Product Strategy

## ðŸŽ¯ Product Strategy
Our vision is to deliver a unified, AIâ€‘first contract intelligence platform that streamlines contract review and negotiation. The system uses an agentic pipeline that:
- Analyzes single clauses or entire contracts with the same workflow
- Detects user intent (QA, Extract, Redline)
- Surfaces risks and compliance gaps through explainable analysis
- Provides governed safer clause proposals using template libraries
- Connects insights directly to business outcomes with actions like Insert, Track, and Export

This strategy balances technical innovation (multiâ€‘LLM integration, policy lenses, explainability) with business impact (reduced review time, fewer missed renewals, measurable improvements in compliance).

## ðŸš€ Roadmap

### **âœ… IMPLEMENTED (Current Demo)**
- **Unified Agentic Analysis** for both single clauses and contract corpora
- **Intent Classification** (QA, Extract, Redline) with automatic detection
- **Compliance Analysis** with policy lenses (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA)
- **Multi-Contract Selection** with user-friendly compliance contract library
- **Governed Safer Clause Proposals** with template-based generation
- **Business Outcome Actions**: Insert into Revisions Buffer, Create Tracker, Export Decision Record, Copy Answer
- **Citations & Explainability** with relevance scores and source tracking
- **Revisions Buffer** for managing safer clause proposals
- **Export Functionality** for decision records (Markdown format)

### **ðŸ”„ IN DEVELOPMENT (Next 3-6 Months)**
- **Custom Trackers Builder** with user-defined fields and roll-ups
- **Contract Comparison** with side-by-side version analysis
- **Clause Library** with preferred/fallback templates and versioning
- **Advanced Retrieval** with vector embeddings for better clause matching
- **Prompt A/B Testing Harness** for quality and latency optimization

### **ðŸ“‹ PLANNED (6-12 Months)**
- **Portfolio Dashboard** with renewal runway, risk distribution, and SLA coverage
- **Workflow Integration** for approvals and collaboration
- **Enterprise Integrations** with Drive, SharePoint, and Workday objects
- **Advanced Analytics** with drift detection and quality metrics
- **Multi-Language Support** for international compliance frameworks
