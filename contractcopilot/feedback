âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Great question. Make the call-to-action crystal clear and outcome-oriented so a reviewer instantly sees what the agent does and what they can do next.

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: What the CTA should be

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Use one primary CTA everywhere:

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Primary CTA (both modes):
"Run Agentic Analysis"

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Then adapt the sub-label to the input source:
	â€¢	Single clause: "(Single Clause)"
	â€¢	Uploaded files: "(Corpus)"

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: What we're analyzing (in one sentence)

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: We take your clause or corpus, detect the user's intent, retrieve the most relevant clauses, synthesize a grounded answer with citations, andâ€”when appropriateâ€”propose a safer clause you can insert.

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Buttons & flow (so it shows your PM thinking)

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Before run
	â€¢	Text area (Single Clause) / Uploader + optional question (Corpus)
	â€¢	Optional "Policy Lens" dropdown (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc.)

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Primary: Run Agentic Analysis
âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Helper copy (one line): "Classify â†’ Retrieve â†’ Synthesize â†’ Propose (with citations)."

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: After run (global actions)
	â€¢	Insert Safer Clause (writes proposed clause into a "Revisions" buffer)
	â€¢	Create Tracker from this Finding (pre-fill field like Renewal Notice, Liability Cap)
	â€¢	Export Decision Record (answer + citations + proposed clause â†’ Markdown/PDF)
	â€¢	Copy Answer (plain text)

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: After run (per-citation actions)
	â€¢	Analyze Inline (quick metadata on that clause)
	â€¢	Open in Single Clause (deep dive on that one clause)
	â€¢	Insert This Clause (if you want to keep the original clause for comparison)

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Microcopy to put right under the CTA
	â€¢	"Grounded in retrieved clauses; every answer includes citations."
	â€¢	"Safer clause proposals use governed templates (no free-form drafting)."

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Dynamic CTA label (optional polish)

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: If you want the button to reflect detected intent, switch the label after classification:
	â€¢	Intent = qa â†’ "Run Agentic Analysis"
	â€¢	Intent = extract â†’ "Extract & Summarize"
	â€¢	Intent = redline â†’ "Propose Safer Clause"

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: (You can show the detected intent as a tiny caption: "Intent: qa â†’ Steps: classify â†’ retrieve â†’ synthesize".)

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: What exactly is analyzed (bullet points you can show in UI)
	â€¢	Intent: QA vs. Extract vs. Redline
	â€¢	Retrieval: Top-k clauses from the clause index (BM25 now; vectors later)
	â€¢	Synthesis: Concise 2â€“4 sentence answer with [n] citations
	â€¢	Proposal (when applicable): Curated safer clause (liability / indemnity / renewal / notice)
	â€¢	Optional lens: Compliance hints (GDPR/CCPA/HIPAAâ€¦) appended to the plan

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Minimal labels you can drop into the app now
	â€¢	Header: ðŸ¤– Agentic Analysis (Single Clause | Corpus)
	â€¢	Primary button: Run Agentic Analysis
	â€¢	Sections post-run: AI Answer, Citations, Suggested Safer Clause, Next Actions
	â€¢	Next Actions buttons: Insert Safer Clause Â· Create Tracker Â· Export Decision Record Â· Copy Answer

âœ… IMPLEMENTED: This keeps everything consistent (no "Ask AI" vs "Agentic" split), shows your product thinking (next-step actions tied to business outcomes), and demonstrates explainability (citations) and governance (templates, trackers, export).
