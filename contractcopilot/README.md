## 🛠️ **Technical Setup (For Review)**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- One API key: **OpenAI**, **Cohere**, **Groq**, or **Gemini**

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd contractcopilot

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up API keys (optional - works in demo mode)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export PROVIDER=openai

# Run the application
streamlit run app.py
```

### API Key Setup
The demo supports multiple LLM providers in priority order:
1. **Groq** (Ultra-fast inference) - Primary choice
2. **Gemini** (Google's AI model) - Fast alternative  
3. **OpenAI** (GPT-4) - Reliable option
4. **Cohere** - Backup provider

**Note**: The demo works without API keys using mock responses for demonstration purposes.
